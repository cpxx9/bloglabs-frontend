# BlogLabs

This is a Blog site that I created as one of the final projects for The Odin Project, but decided to build out further into something I can actually use. 
I wanted to learn more about these technologies rather than just build a project site.

It's using React for the front end, NodeJS (Express) for the API, JWTs for authentication and secure routing, and PostgresSQL as the database

Any tips/ideas are always welcome!
